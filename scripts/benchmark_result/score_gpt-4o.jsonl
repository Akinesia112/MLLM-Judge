{"score_id": 2, "name": "gpt4", "answer": "The image shows a meal with various items, but it does not appear to contain any fruit. Instead, there is a sandwich which seems to be a Cuban sandwich cut in half, rice that appears to be yellow rice, possibly seasoned with saffron or a similar spice, and a side of black beans. Additionally, there is an item that looks like an ear of corn, which is seasoned and possibly grilled, served with a lime wedge on the side. The corn is the closest item to a fruit here, as botanically speaking, corn kernels are the seeds of a type of grass and considered a grain, and grains are a type of fruit in the botanical sense. However, in culinary terms, corn is generally not referred to as a fruit. Thus, there is no typical culinary fruit depicted in this image.", "id": 100, "instruction": "Please analyse this figure in detail and answer the following question based on this figure: What fruit is shown?", "image_path": "100.jpg", "original_dataset": "coco", "human": 4, "mllm_judge": "{\n  \"Analysis\": \"The assistant's response accurately describes the contents of the image, identifying a Cuban sandwich, yellow rice, black beans, and an ear of corn with a lime wedge.
