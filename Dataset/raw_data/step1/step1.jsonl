His design features two arched ribs, one on either side of the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is suspended from the arches by vertical risers. Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to crossing a pony truss bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened. There are only half a dozen Marsh rainbow arch bridges remaining in Minnesota. "}

He was governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1757 to 1760, and afterwards sat in the House of Commons from 1767 to 1780. He travelled widely in the North American colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War, opposed Parliamentary attempts to tax the colonies, and was a minority advocate of colonial positions until the Revolution.\nClassically educated and well-connected to the colonial administration in London, Pownall first travelled to North America in 1753, and spent two years exploring the colonies before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 1755. He became governor of Massachusetts in 1757 after helping engineer the recall of longtime Governor William Shirley.  His administration was dominated by the French and Indian War (called the \"Seven Years War\" in England) in which Pownall was instrumental in raising Massachusetts provincial militia for the war effort.  He opposed military interference in colonial administration, including attempts to quarter British troops in private homes, and had a generally positive relationship with the colonial assembly.\nReturning to England in 1760, he continued to be interested in colonial affairs, publishing widely read materials on conditions in the colonies, including several editions of The Administration of the Colonies.  As a Member of Parliament he regularly advocated for colonial positions without much success, but supported the war effort once the Revolutionary War began.  In the early 19th century he became an early advocate of the reduction or removal of trade barriers, and the establishment of a solid relationship between Britain and the United States.  Several writers have proposed that Pownall was Junius, a pseudonymous writer of letters critical of British governmental practices.\nJohn Adams wrote, \"Pownall was the most constitutional and national Governor, in my opinion, who ever represented the crown in this province.\" "}

Basically all predictions that said that the PS would win comfortably the election, were wrong. As a result, the party also lost five of its twelve MEP's. The Social Democrats (PSD) were the big winners in these elections, surprising pundits and analysts who predicted a very complicated result for the PSD leader, Manuela Ferreira Leite. The PSD won 31.7% of the vote and 8 seats. It was the first victory of the PSD, in European elections, since 1989. The People's Party (CDS-PP) also had a surprising result, winning 8% of the vote and electing 2 MEP's. Both PSD and CDS-PP, who ran in a joint list in 2004, increased sharply their scores and together they won more than 40% of the vote and 10 MEP's.\nOn the left, both the Left Bloc (BE) and Democratic Unity Coalition (CDU) achieved very good results with the historic fact that BE surpassed CDU in term of votes and seats for the first time, although only just. Both parties increased their scores at the expense of the Socialist Party. The Left Bloc won 10.7% of the vote and 3 MEP's, their best score in EU elections to date, and CDU surpassed once again the 10% mark winning 10.6% of the vote, but maintaining the 2 MEP they got in 2004.\nTurnout in the elections was quite low, as only 36.78% of the electorate cast a ballot, a slightly lower share than in the 2004 election. Although the number of ballots cast was higher than in 2004, the number of registered voters increased considerably in these elections, making the final turnout share lower than in 2004. "}

Here is the text: Cockatiels are small birds originally from Australia and are related to many other cockatoos. They are the second most common bird species kept as a pet. Cockatiels can live from 10 to 25 years, depending on how healthy their lifestyle is, although wild cockatiels usually live shorter. \nCockatiels have tiny feathers on their head called a crest. The crest allows the owner to have an idea of what they are feeling; straight up if scared or excited, flat when they're angry, and slightly curved is normal/happy.\nIn the wild, cockatiels are prey animals, meaning there are predators that eat them. As a result, cockatiels can scare easily, especially when they meet someone or something they do not know. With enough patience and affection, an owner can tame the cockatiel and help them get over their natural fear. Like many other parrots, cockatiels are very good at climbing, and use their beak to position themselves each time.\nCockatiels come in many different colours, some naturally while others were specifically bred. Gray is considered to be their original colour, and is one of the most popular, along with Lutino (yellow). Males have a brighter crest and face, and sing louder and more frequently than females. A cockatiel has very long tail feathers compared to other birds.\nSeeds make up most of their diet, but veterinarians strongly recommend various fruits, vegetables, and beans as well. However, a few of these may be harmful to them, and it is advised to be cautious with what they eat. It can be very hard to get adults to try new foods, so it is best to have them try little by little at a time instead of all at once.\nLike other birds, they can be taught to do many tricks; including flips, handshakes, fly-on-command, showing their wings, and more. Patience and repetition is key, as teaching one trick can take many months. They can also be taught to sing, but may become confused and ruin the song if it's too complex.\nCockatiels are social birds, and like to spend time with others. They can become overly attached to their owners over time (especially if raised young), and may start to shriek when they feel lonely. If the owner is unable to spend a lot of time with them, getting them a partner (preferably another cockatiel) can help resolve their clinginess. "}

It grows on non-calcareous rock, wood, and bark. It often has tiny lobate areoles in the shape of lion claws. The areoles may be flat or convex. Its sexual reproduction structures (apothecia) are a 0.35\u20131.0\u00a0mm-wide disc, darker yellow than the thallus, rimmed with thallus-like tissue lecanorine, flat but becoming convex with age. Lichen spot tests are K+ reddish, KC-, and C-. It produces calycin, pulvinic acid, pulvinic dilactone and vulpinic acid as secondary metabolites.\nIn California, it prefers growing on granite, but can also be found on wood (rarely on bark) and other kinds of rock.\nCandelariella vitellina looks like a miniature version of C.\u00a0rosulans. It can be distinguished by C.\u00a0vitanela having a visible exciple (the rim around the apothecia disc), which C.\u00a0rosulans does not have. It is usually much larger and thicker than the similar C.\u00a0lutella. "}

Cyrus' father, Henry, died in 1835 and most of the family, including Gideon, then migrated westward to Pekin, Illinois. Paul moved to Louisville, Kentucky, but Cyrus chose to stay in Greenbrier County. Why Cyrus and his brothers came to Greenbrier County is not known. However, there were Henkles in the area and were possibly related to their mother.\nCyrus became friends with Andrew McClung and it is probably through him that Cyrus began to acquire property near the mouth of Big Clear Creek.

Spreckels in 1892. The railroad's original network consisted of five routes: the Fifth Street and Logan Heights Lines, the First and \"D\" Streets Lines, the Depot Line, the Ferry Line, and the \"K\" Street Shuttle. The company would establish additional operating divisions as traffic demands led to the formation of new lines. The company also engaged in limited freight handling primarily as an interchange with Spreckels' San Diego and Arizona Railway (SD&A) from 1923 to 1929.\nAt its peak, the SDERy's routes would operate throughout the greater San Diego area over some 165 miles (266\u00a0km) of track. Steadily declining ridership, due in large part to the phenomenal rise in popularity of the automobile, ultimately led the company to discontinue all streetcar service in favor of bus routes in 1949. Some see this as related to the National City Lines's General Motors streetcar conspiracy controversy, as the SDERy's president had been with NCL previously.\nThe few surviving pieces of rolling stock are on display at the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, the San Diego Electric Railway Association in National City, and the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California.

He was posted to the 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade, then serving on the Western Front. Wounded during the Battle of Messines when he destroyed two machine gun posts, an action that earned him the VC, he received medical treatment in England. He then underwent officer training but his health was still poor and before the end of the war he was returned to New Zealand. \nPost war, Frickleton served in the New Zealand Staff Corps before returning to civilian life in 1927. He tried farming and worked as a house manager. In the mid-1930s, Frickleton joined the part time Territorial Force and would be later awarded the Efficiency Decoration (ED). He went to London in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and again nearly 20 years later for the VC centenary.

Here is the text: Penstemon penlandii is a rare species of flowering plant in the plantain family known by the common names Penland penstemon and Penland's beardtongue. It is endemic to Colorado in the United States, where it is known only from a strip of land about five miles long in central Grand County. There are two occurrences totalling about 8600 individuals. This is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.\nThis plant was discovered in the 1980s during surveys for Osterhout's milkvetch (Astragalus osterhoutii), another rare local endemic. The two plants are found only in Middle Park, a valley with seleniferous badlands that host a unique flora. The penstemon grows in clay that is rich in selenium, an element toxic to most other plants in high concentrations. In adjacent stretches of land that have a lower selenium content the penstemon population becomes thinner and it is replaced by sagebrush. The penstemon grows in the shade of the banks of runoff channels that are periodically flooded; the plant's deep, ropelike roots and rhizome anchor it to underground shale deposits to prevent it from being torn away during floods.\nThis perennial herb arises from a woody caudex attached to the thick root system. The flowering stems are up to 25 centimeters tall with small, linear leaves. The inflorescence contains up to 15 purple-blue flowers each measuring roughly 1.5 centimeters long. They are tubular opening into wide mouths containing staminodes tipped with orange hairs. The plants are partly self-compatible, but for more efficient fruit production the flowers must be visited by pollinators. Many species of bees, especially of genus Osmia, pollinate the flowers, as does the beardtongue-specialist pollen wasp Pseudomasaris vespoides. Blooming occurs in June and July.\n\nThe plant occurs in a section of land in northern Middle Park measuring about 5 miles or 2.4 kilometers long and under a kilometer wide. It was added to the US Endangered Species List the same day as its fellow local endemic Osterhout's milkvetch. They are both naturally rare and are threatened by off-road vehicle use in their barren, dry habitat. The penstemon is threatened by the maintenance of a nearby road. Mineral exploration may also be a threat in the area. "}

The validity of these specimens was doubted and many believed they were intentionally produced hybrids, a common technique in China to produce turtles that get high prices.\nIn 2007, He et al. sampled the three living specimens and gave the genetic proof that all three living specimens are indeed C. yunnanensis and not hybrids. In 2008, Kadoorie Conservation China, a department of Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, together with the Kunming Institute of Zoology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered a small wild population.

Here is the text: Weight pulling is a dog sport involving a dog pulling a cart or sled loaded with weight a short distance across dirt/gravel, grass, carpet, or snow.  It is a modern adaptation of freighting, in which dogs were used as freight animals to move cargo. Many breeds participate in this sport, with dogs being separated into classes by weight. Sled dog and bull breeds excel within their respective weight classes, having been historically bred to pull sleds and carts as working dogs, respectively.  \nThe dog is hitched to the cart or sled with a specially constructed harness designed to spread the weight and minimize the chance of injury. Since IWPA's organization in 1984, no dogs have been hurt in competition.\nDog weight pulling competitions are sanctioned by various non-profit organizations. In North America the International Sled Dog Racing Association has sanctioned contests in association with their races. The International Weight Pulling Association was organized in 1984 to promote the heritage of the working dog.  IWPA operates in North America.\nSince 2000, the American Pulling Alliance  has also offered sanctioned competitions in North America as well as Europe.  The United Kennel Club  also includes Weight Pull as one of their dog sports.  Alaskan Malamute Clubs in the UK, and Australia  offer sanctioned weight pull competitions based on the Alaskan Malamute Club of America's weight pull rules.  Other breed clubs also offer weight pull, such as American Dog Breeders Association.  In the 2010s other organizations started offering sanctioned competitions, such as National Working Dog Association.  In 2012, GPA (Global Pulling Alliance) was formed to focus on educating the general public about the sport of weight pulling as a positive outlet for active canines across the globe. GPA holds competitions in 6 countries; United Kingdom, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Ireland, and the United States, and continues to add to their list as the sport grows in popularity. Other organizations are springing up in Europe and Asia as the sport becomes increasingly more popular.\nBulgaria also has started to promote the sport by a club called Weight Pulling & Sporting Dogs Bulgaria. Since 2014 Lithuania has a dog weight pulling club called \"Weight Pulling Lithuania\". "}

Here is the text: Ares Vallis /\u02c8\u025b\u0259ri\u02d0z \u02c8v\u00e6l\u026as/ is an outflow channel on Mars, named after the Greek  name for Mars: Ares,  the god of war; it appears to have been carved by fluids, perhaps water. The valley 'flows' northwest out of the hilly Margaritifer Terra, where the Iani Chaos depression (180 km long and 200 km wide) is connected to the beginning of Ares Vallis by a 100 km wide transition zone centered on 342.5\u00b0 East (17.5 West) and 3\u00b0 North. It then continues through the ancient Xanthe Terra highlands, and ends in a delta-like region of Chryse Planitia. Ares Vallis was the landing site of NASA's Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, which studied a region of the valley near the border with Chryse in 1997.\nAres Vallis is in the Oxia Palus quadrangle of Mars.\nIt has been argued that Uzboi, Ladon, Margaritifer and Ares valles, although now separated by large craters, once comprised a single outflow channel flowing north into Chryse Planitia. The source of this outflow has been suggested as overflow from the Argyre Crater, formerly filled to the brim as a lake by channels (Surius, Dzigai, and Palacopus Valles) draining down from the south pole. If real, the full length of this drainage system would be over 8000\u00a0km, the longest known drainage path in the solar system. Under this suggestion, the extant form of the outflow channel Ares Vallis would thus be a remolding of a pre-existing structure.  This long path for water flow has been named the * Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) system.  Water from this system may have helped to form Ares Vallis.\nResearch, published in January 2010, suggests that Mars had lakes, each around 20\u00a0km wide, along parts of the equator. Although earlier research showed that Mars had a warm and wet early history that has long since dried up, these lakes existed in the Hesperian Epoch, a much earlier period. Using detailed image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the researchers speculate that there may have been increased volcanic activity, meteorite impacts or shifts in Mars' orbit during this period to warm Mars' atmosphere enough to melt the abundant ice present in the ground. Volcanoes would have released gases that thickened the atmosphere for a temporary period, trapping more sunlight and making it warm enough for liquid water to exist. In this new study, channels were discovered that connected lake basins near Ares Vallis. When one lake filled up, its waters overflowed the banks and carved the channels to a lower area where another lake would form. These lakes would be another place to look for evidence of present or past life. "}

The effect of Roman's victory was, however, undermined by new divisions among the princes of Rus\u2019.\nRoman died in a battle with the Poles at the Battle of Zawichost. He founded the Romanovich dynasty, which would rule Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Halych until 1340. "}

Here is the text: The Frederick Squires House is a historic house located at 1003 West Church Street in Champaign, Illinois. Owner and architect Frederick Squires created the Craftsman style house in 1927. Squires combined two similar 1870s frame houses, one of which was moved from another site in Champaign, to build his house. In addition to using existing houses to form a new one, Squires used recycled wood, brick, and concrete to complete his new home. The house's interior design incorporates principles of Craftsman design such as an open floor plan, use of natural materials throughout, and an entrance hall that functions as a room in its own right.\nBorn in 1879 in Plainfield, New Jersey, Frederick Squires graduated from Williams College with a BA in Architecture and then attended the School of Mines of Columbia University, the earliest mining and metallurgy school in the United States, established in 1864. Squires then worked as an architect until 1914. He was active in designing office buildings in New York City as well as in publishing designs in outlets such as Architectural Record, Concrete-Cement Age, and House and Garden. He published a book entitled The Hollow Tile House (1913) on a new construction technique that he had developed. One year later, he published the quirky Architectonics: The Tales of Tom Thumtack, Architect, illustrated by Rockwell Kent. From 1914 on, Squires worked with his brother in the oil business, but he maintained his interest in architecture, as demonstrated by the unique design of his Craftsman style home.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 22, 2011.

It is home to the Sentinelese, an indigenous people in voluntary isolation who have rejected, often violently, any contact with the outside world. They are among the last tribal people to remain virtually untouched by modern civilisation.\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Act of 1956 prohibits travel to the island and any approach closer than five nautical miles (9.26\u00a0km) in order to prevent the resident tribespeople from contracting diseases to which they have no immunity. The area is patrolled by the Indian Navy. \nNominally, the island belongs to the South Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In practice, Indian authorities recognise the islanders' desire to be left alone and restrict their role to remote monitoring; they do not prosecute them for killing people. The island is a protected area of India.

It was the first feature-length film adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. The story follows the life of the title character (played by William Jossey), who kills his cousin (Francis McDonald) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (Gypsy Abbott). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit Bertram Bracken, while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards's directorial debut.\nSome reviewers praised the scenery and overall production quality, considering the film an improvement over staged adaptations of the novel. Others found the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records. The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, Beulah, was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, St. Elmo is now believed lost. "}

He was a left-handed pitcher over parts of fourteen seasons (1908\u20131921) with the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants and Cincinnati Reds. For his career, he compiled a 174\u2013143 record in 476 appearances, with a 2.56 earned run average and 836 strikeouts. In Cardinals' franchise history, Sallee ranks 3rd all-time in earned run average (2.67), 7th in innings pitched (1905.1), 8th in games started (215) and wins (106, tied with Adam Wainwright), and 7th in losses (107).\nSallee pitched in two World Series, both against the Chicago White Sox, and was a member of the victorious Reds in the infamous \"Black Sox\" 1919 World Series. He produced the best season of his career for the 1919 Reds, going 21\u20137 with a 2.06 earned run average. He lost a World Series to the White Sox as a member of the 1917 Giants, starting Game 1 and losing 2-1 to Sox ace Eddie Cicotte in Chicago, driving in his team's only run. In World Series play, Sallee compiled a 1\u20133 record in four appearances, with a 3.45 earned run average and six strikeouts. Also in 1919, Sallee became just the second pitcher (at that time) to have more wins than walks in a season. Christy Mathewson did it twice (1913, 1914) and Bret Saberhagen accomplished this feat in 1994 with the New York Mets.\nSallee was born and later died in Higginsport, Ohio, at the age of 65. He was buried at Confidence Cemetery in Georgetown, Ohio. "}
