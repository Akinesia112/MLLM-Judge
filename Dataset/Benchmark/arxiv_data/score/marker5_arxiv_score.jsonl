The bird is perched on a tree branch, which could indicate that it is native to the area. However, the bird's presence in the tree could also suggest that it is using the tree as a temporary resting spot during migration. To determine the bird's migratory status, more information would be needed, such as the bird's specific species, its geographic location, and the time of year. If the bird is a migratory species, it would be more likely to be native to a different region and would be using the tree as a temporary resting spot during its migration. On the other hand, if the bird is native to the area, it would be more likely to be using the tree as a regular resting or nesting spot.", "id": 114, "instruction": "Please analyse this figure in detail and answer the following question based on this figure: Is the bird migrating or native?", "image_path": "image/114.jpg", "original_dataset": "coco", "human_answer": 3}

The setting seems informal and personal due to the presence of what might be personal items (cigarettes and reading material) and the casual arrangement of food items. Based on these observations, if one had to guess what section of the school this meal would be eaten in, it could be a teacher's lounge, a staff break room, or a common area where faculty and possibly senior students have the privilege to have a more relaxed environment. This guess is derived from the presence of cigarettes which are unlikely to be openly displayed in a student cafeteria or classroom due to school policies regarding smoking. Additionally, the quality and presentation of the pastries suggest that this might not be typical student fare. The single chair implies that the meal is intended for one person, which could indicate a personal break time rather than a communal dining area.", "id": 126, "instruction": "Please analyse this figure in detail and answer the following question based on this figure: If you had to guess what section of the school would this meal be eaten?", "image_path": "image/126.jpg", "original_dataset": "coco", "human_answer": 5}

First, we need to find the number of people who were born in England and N.Ireland. Next, we need to find the total number of people in the UK. In the infographic, we can see that the number of people who were born in England and N.Ireland is 53,300,000. To find the total number of people in the UK, we need to add the number of people born in England and N.Ireland to the number of people born in Scotland and Wales. The total number of people in the UK is 63,700,000. Now, we can calculate the percentage of people whose birth of place is in England and N.Ireland in 2011 by dividing the number of people born in England and N.Ireland by the total number of people in the UK and multiplying the result by 100. (53,300,000 / 63,700,000) \\* 100 = 83.5% So, the percentage of people whose birth of place is in England and N.Ireland in 2011 is 83.5%.", "id": 1009, "instruction": "Please analyse this figure in detail and answer the following question based on this figure: What is the percentage of people whose birth of place is in England and N.Ireland in 2011?", "image_path": "image/1009.jpg", "original_dataset": "infographicsVQA", "human_answer": 2}

Since \u2220BEC is given as 35\u00b0 and BE is the bisector of \u2220FBD, we can deduce that 2x = \u2220FBD = \u2220BEC + \u2220CED = 35\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 70\u00b0, which means that x = \u2220FBE = \u2220EBD = 35\u00b0. Now, \u2220FAE is formed by the rays AE and AF. Since AE is an extension of BE, \u2220FAE is an exterior angle to triangle BEC, which means \u2220FAE = \u2220FBE + \u2220BEC = x + \u2220BEC.

Lines $l$, $m$, and $n$ are perpendicular bisectors of this triangle, and they meet at a point $T$. The lengths of these lines are given as $TQ = 2x$, $PT = 3y - 1$, and $TR = 8$. To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of perpendicular bisectors. Perpendicular bisectors are lines that pass through the center of the triangle and are perpendicular to each of its sides. In this case, lines $l$, $m$, and $n$ are perpendicular bisectors of triangle $PQR$. First, let's find the coordinates of point $T$. Since lines $l$, $m$, and $n$ are perpendicular bisectors, they are equidistant from each side of the triangle. This means that $T$ is equidistant from points $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We can use the distance formula to find the coordinates of $T$: $d(T, P) = d(T, Q) = d(T, R) = \\frac{1}{2}$ Solving for $T$ in terms of $P$, $Q$, and $R$, we get: $T = \\frac{1}{2}(P + Q + R)$ Now, we can substitute the given values for $TQ$, $PT$, and $TR$ into the equation for $T$: $2x = \\frac{1}{2}(P + Q + R)$ $3y - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}(P + Q + R)$ $8 = \\frac{1}{2}(P + Q + R)$ Simplifying these equations, we get: $x = \\frac{1}{4}(P + Q + R)$ $y = \\frac{3}{4}(P + Q + R) - \\frac{1}{2}$ $z = \\frac{1}{4}(P + Q + R)$ Therefore, the value of $z$ is $\\frac{1}{4}(P + Q + R)$.", "id": 1534, "instruction": "This is a figure including mathematical information.

Since they are perpendicular bisectors, PT = TQ and TR = TP. We are given TQ = 2x, PT = 3y - 1, and TR = 8. This means that 2x = 3y - 1 and 8 = 3y - 1. By setting the equations equal to each other, we can solve for y: 2x = 8, so x = 4. To find z, we look at PR which is bisected by line n. Since TR is 8, and PR is divided into two equal segments by T, then PT must also be 8, which gives us 3y - 1 = 8. Solving for y, we get 3y = 9, hence y = 3. Now, we need to find z. The line segment PR is also divided into z + 4 and 7 by T. Since PT = 8, and PT is the sum of z + 4 and 7, we have z + 4 + 7 = 8. This simplifies to z + 11 = 8, hence z = -3. However, this is a contradiction since distances cannot be negative. This implies there might be a mistake in the initial equations or in the assumptions made. Let's re-evaluate: if PT = 8 and TR = 8, then PR = PT + TR = 8 + 8 = 16. Since PR is the sum of z + 4 and 7, we get z + 4 + 7 = 16.

Using the sine function,  sin(90\u00b0) = 1/2 sin(72\u00b0) = 1/2 Using the law of sines, the length of the side labeled 'S' is  2\u221a(1/2) = 2\u221a(0.5) = 2\u221a2 = 4\u221a1 = 4\u221a2 = 8\u221a1 = 8\u221a2 = 16\u221a1 = 16\u221a2 = 64\u221a1 = 64\u221a2 = 256\u221a1 = 256\u221a2 = 1024\u221a1 = 1024\u221a2 = 4160.
